# weathersite

Simple project using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow a user to search for a location (within the US), select, and view a 7-day weather forecast for the selected location.

Installation instructions:
- Clone repo
- Install the required modules via 'npm install' (I think)
- Debug any errors
- Browse to 'localhost:3000' to view site (probably)

API connection with:
- Weatherbit.io (for weather data and icons)
- Miserlou's API (to retrieve city names)
